# Advent of Code 2022

Link of the challenge : https://adventofcode.com/

## Organization

Since we will be several at doing challenge, I propose we use the following code structure:
  - at the top level, a directory per day (`01`, `02`, …)
  - in each "day directory", a directory per user based on your GitHub handle (`cyrilmottier`, etc.). In this dorectory, you are free to do whatever you want!

```
├── 01
│   ├── cyrilmottier
│   │   ├── day01-part2.kts
│   │   ├── day01.kts
│   │   └── input.txt
│   ├── johndoe
│   │   └── foo
│   │       ├── bar
│   │       ├── baz
```

Of course, you are free to participate whenever you wish to do so. Don't feel forced to anything.
